I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Boston College, where I specialize in International Relations and U.S. foreign policy. My research focuses on maritime security with a regional focus on the Asia-Pacific and U.S.-China relations. I was an instructor/assistant professor in the Department of Military History at Korea Military Academy in 2013-2016 and a Hans. J. Morgenthau fellow in 2022-2023. I hold an M.A. in International Relations and a B.A. in Political Science from Seoul National University.
 
My dissertation, supported by the Fulbright Graduate Ph.D. scholarship, the Hans. J. Morgenthau fellowship, and the Charles Koch Foundation U.S. foreign policy dissertation grant, examines the immediate conditions under which the leading sea power and a challenger can arrive at a strategic settlement despite the intense security competition associated with naval power shifts.

Specifically, I conduct comparative historical case studies of the two Anglo-French dyads (1856-1870/1882-1904) and the U.S.-Japan dyad (1921-1941) with the ultimate goal of developing a theory to apply to current U.S.-China relations. At root, I argue that the outcome of a naval power transition is contingent upon two conditions: (1) the interactive dynamics of a challenger’s expansion and the leading sea power’s expectation about its contagion effect; and (2) whether alignment opportunity, shaped by third common threats, available allies, and neutrals in the theaters of the power transition, is open or closed. I argue that while bilateral resource-extraction capacities strengthen or erode the underlying condition of security competition, it is the interactive dynamics of geographical power projection that bring a conflict to the fore and determine its outcome.
