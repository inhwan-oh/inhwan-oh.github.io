I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Government at the College of William & Mary. I specialize in International Relations and U.S. Foreign Policy. My research focuses on maritime security with a regional focus on the Asia-Pacific and U.S.-China relations. 
 
My dissertation, supported by the Fulbright Graduate Ph.D. Scholarship, the Hans. J. Morgenthau Fellowship, the Charles Koch Foundation U.S. Foreign Policy Dissertation, and the Stand Together Trust U.S. Foreign Policy Dissertation Grant, examines the immediate conditions under which the leading sea power shows a greater resolve to use military force over a certain area, but not other areas, in its peripheral theaters in response to a challengerâ€™s power projection during a naval arms race. 

Prior to joining William & Mary, I taught at Boston College as an instructor in 2024. I was also an instructor and Assistant Professor in the Department of Military History at Korea Military Academy from 2013-2016 and a Hans. J. Morgenthau Fellow from 2022-2023. I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Boston College, an M.A. in International Relations, and a B.A. in Political Science from Seoul National University.
