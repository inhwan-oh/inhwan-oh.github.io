Why do the leading sea power and a challenger sometimes fight a war despite naval power disparity and geographic distance? Conversely, how do these powers come to a strategic settlement even with naval power parity and geographical proximity? Existing flagship theories in realism, such as the balance of power theory and hegemonic shift theories, are ill-equipped to answer these questions. Systemic anticipations based on the redistribution of power are probabilistic and indeterminate per se. To fill this gap, I construct a mid-range theory, An Interacative Theory of Power Projection, that incorporates the geographical dimension of power projection in determining the outcome of naval power shifts. 
Specifically, I conduct comparative historical case studies of the two Anglo-French dyads (1856-1870/1882-1904) and the U.S.-Japan dyad (1921-1941) with the ultimate goal of developing a theory to apply to current U.S.-China relations. At root, I argue that the outcome of a naval power transition is contingent upon two conditions: (1) the interactive dynamics of a challenger’s expansion and the leading sea power’s expectation about its contagion effect; and (2) whether alignment opportunity, shaped by third common threats, available allies, and neutrals in the theaters of the power transition, is open or closed. I argue that while bilateral resource-extraction capacities strengthen or erode the underlying condition of security competition, it is the interactive dynamics of geographical power projection that bring a conflict to the fore and determine its outcome. These findings carry policy implications for U.S.-China relations and U.S. foreign policy.
