Greetings!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Boston College, where I specialize in international relations and U.S. foreign policy. In particular, my research focuses on maritime security with a regional focus on the Asia-Pacific and U.S.-China relations. I was an instrutor/assistant professor in the Department of Military History at Korea Military Academy in 2013-2016 and a Hans. J. Morgenthau fellow in 2022-2023. 

My dissertation, supported by the Fulbright Graduate Ph.D. scholarship, the Hans. J. Morgenthau fellowship, and the Charles Koch Foundation U.S. foreign policy dissertation grant, examines the immediate conditions under which the leading sea power and a challenger can arrive at a strategic settlemt despite the underlying source of intense security competition associated with naval power shifts.
